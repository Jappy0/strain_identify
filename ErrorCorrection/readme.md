# Isolates correction workflow

- **Step 1**: Begin with a smallRNA_propor corrected dataset $D$. To distinguish between high and low-frequency reads, we apply a predetermined frequency threshold, denoted as Ï„. Divide the reads into two groups accordingly: high-frequency and low-frequency.

- **Step 2**: Identify all 1-edit-distance relationships between the high-frequency and low-frequency reads. Construct a read graph with sequences as nodes and relationships as edges.

- **Step 3**: Based on the isolated sequences in the read graph, separate the original dataset $D$ into two sets: isolates contained dataset $D1$ and non-isolates contained dataset $D2$.

- **Step 4**: Correct dataset $D1$ using karect, resulting in the corrected dataset $D1'$. Merge the corrected dataset $D1'$ and $D2$ to obtain the final corrected dataset.
